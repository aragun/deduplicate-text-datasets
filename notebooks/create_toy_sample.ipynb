It was ahead of its time. It was sensual, ethereal and dangerous, a combination which no one had ever put together,\" says Booth. \u0000 So he suggested the collaboration idea to Mercury Records and was surprised at the response. \"They just said 'Fine, go and do it' and that was it,\" says Booth, who had expected at least some resistance. Dave Bates, head of A&R at the label, was the man with the open mind. \"Just after Wah Wah [James's last album], Tim came up with the idea of doing a solo project and asked me what I thought. I told him to go ahead, so he went and pursued this dream,\" says Bates. \"He needed to do something completely different in a different environment. It had to be a complete change and Angelo's non-rock, non-pop, non-alternative way of thinking was perfect.\" \u0000 However, Booth's approach was just one of many which Badalamenti had to field in the wake of his work with Cruise and, subsequently, on the Twin Peaks soundtrack. \"I worked with Anthrax on a track on the White Noise album and I did some stuff with Michael Jackson, but I turned down loads of stuff - Tori Amos, Leonard CohenŠ often because I just didn't have the time,\" says the 54 year-old composer.\n",
